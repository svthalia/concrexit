Getting started
---------------

0. Get at least Python 3.7 and install poetry and the Pillow requirements as per below.
1. Clone this repository
2. `make superuser` to create the first user (note that this user won't be a member!)
3. `make fixtures` to generate a bunch of test data
4. `make run` to run a testing server
5. Go to the user you created and complete the profile and add a membership for full access

Testing and linting
-------------------

You can use [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) (on Unix systems) to test in different python
environments.

All code has to be run through [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) before being committed. To black the code before committing run `make fmt` one the base directory of this project.
If you want to integrate `black` with your editor look in the [`black` docs](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/editor_integration.html). On linux you can find the black executable in `~/.cache/poety/virtualenvs/<your env>/bin/black`.

You can run all the tests with `make test`, afterwards you can check the coverage with `make coverage`.

poetry
------

Install poetry per the [poetry documentation][poetry install]. Make sure you install at least version 1.x.x.

[poetry install]: https://github.com/sdispater/poetry#installation

Pillow dependencies
-------------------

For Ubuntu 18.04, use:

    apt-get install python3-dev gettext gcc build-essential libtiff5-dev libjpeg-turbo8-dev zlib1g-dev libfreetype6-dev liblcms2-dev libwebp-dev

Or try:

    apt-get build-dep python3-pil

For other operating systems, see the [Pillow Documentation][pillow-install].


[pillow-install]: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html


On macOS you will also need to install `libmagic`, using the brew package manager by running `brew install libmagic`.

Thabloid dependencies
---------------------

To be able to generate JPGs from PDFs, we need ghostscript:

    apt-get install ghostscript

Or for macOS:

    brew install ghostscript

Language
------------------

Make sure to use British English.

Settings
------------------

The settings of our project are located in `website/thaliawebsite/settings`.
This is a Python module that loads the included settings files based on the environment you are running in.

- If `DJANGO_PRODUCTION` is set in the environment `production.py` will be included
- If `GITHUB_ACTIONS` is set in the environment `testing.py` will be included
- If `localsettings.py` exists it will be included, you can use this to override settings on your local development server without the risk of committing secrets.

`settings.py` contains the default included settings.

Documentation
------------------

The documentation for our code is located inside the files and is combined using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) into an HTML output.
The continuous integration checks if the latest Python modules are included in the Sphinx files located in the `docs` folder

To update these files run `make apidocs`

To render the docs to HTML run `make docs`
