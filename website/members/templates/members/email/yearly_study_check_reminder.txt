Dear {{ name }},

You have a study membership with Thalia. This means that you'll be a member as
long as you're enrolled in either a Computing Science or an Information Sciences programme.

Are you still studying? Then please follow the link in this URL {{ renewal_url }} to make sure you stay member for another year.
Did you graduate or stop with your studies for any other reason? Then you can simply ignore this message, and your membership will automatically end.

Since the first of september has passed, your membership is technically over, however you can still prolong it by the link above, until we minimize your personal data.
If you find this email after your profile has been minimized contact info@thalia.nu to prolong your membership anyway.

With kind regards,

The board of Study Association Thalia
