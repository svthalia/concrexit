  Dear board,<br>

  <p>It's that time of the year again! The website sent an automatic email to all members.</p>

  <p>That email asks them to check their information we currently have in our database. This means that you can expect an influx of emails from members..</p>

  <p>The email was sent to:</p>
  <ul>
    {% for member in members %}
      <li>{{ member.get_full_name }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
{% endblock %}
