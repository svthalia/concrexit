Dear {{ name }},

The past year you've been a member or benificiary of Study Association Thalia.

If you still want to enjoy all the benefits a membership gives you the coming year
then you'll have to renew it. This'll give you access to activities, the book sale,
our exam collection and a symposium.

Renewing your membership is easy. Open the renewal page on the website and
select the right option: {{ renewal_url }}.

Note that if you upgrade your yearly membership to a study membership before August 31,
you will get a discount of €{{ membership_price }}.

Are you unable to renew your membership via the website? Then send us an email: info@thalia.nu.

It's possible that you've already renewed your membership and that it hasn't 
been processed yet. If that's the case then you don't need to do anything.

With kind regards,

The board of Study Association Thalia
