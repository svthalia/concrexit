Dear {{ name }},

You're a study member of Thalia. This means that you'll be a member as long as 
you're enrolled in either a Computing Science or an Information Sciences programme.

Are you still studying? Then please open {{ renewal_url }} and indicate that you will 
still be studying next year.

Did you graduate or stop with your studies for any other reason? 
Then you can simply ignore this message, and your membership will automatically end.

If you do not indicate that you are still studying, your membership will end by the first of September.
You can still prolong it by following the link, until we minimize your personal data.

With kind regards,

The board of Study Association Thalia
