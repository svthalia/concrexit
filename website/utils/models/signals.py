def suspendingreceiver(signal, **decorator_kwargs):
    """
    A wrapper around the standard django receiver that prevents the receiver
    from running if the setting `SUSPEND_SIGNALS` is `True`.
    This is particularly useful if you want to prevent signals running during
    unit testing.

    @override_settings(SUSPEND_SIGNALS=True)
    class MyTestCase(TestCase):
        def test_method(self):
            Model.objects.create()  # post_save_receiver won't execute

    @suspendingreceiver(post_save, sender=Model)
    def post_save_receiver(sender, instance=None, **kwargs):
        work(instance)
