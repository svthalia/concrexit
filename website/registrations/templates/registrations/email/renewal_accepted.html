  Dear {{ name }},<br>

  <p>We have some wonderful news for you: your membership renewal has been accepted!</p>

  <p>Unfortunately there is still one little thing that we have to take care of before you get access to everything Thalia has to offer once again: paying your membership fees.</p>

  <p>The membership fees are €{{ fees }}. Those can be paid in a few ways:<p>
  <ul>
    {% if thalia_pay_enabled %}
    <li>You can let us withdraw the money from your bank account via Thalia Pay. For this, you will need to have a bank account added to your account and have signed a direct debit mandate. To pay with Thalia Pay, go to <a href="{{ url }}">{{ url }}</a>.</li>
    {% endif %}
    <li>You can transfer the amount of €{{ fees }} to NL 23 INGB 0006 2341 84 with the description "Contribution {{ name }}". Once your payment is processed by us, you will receive a confirmation email.</li>
    <li>You can pay using debit card or cash by visiting the Thalia board room (M1.0.08) during the lunch break (12:15-13:15).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you have any questions, then don't hesitate and send an email to info@thalia.nu.</p>
