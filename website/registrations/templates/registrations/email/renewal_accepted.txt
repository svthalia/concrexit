Dear {{ name }},
We have some wonderful news for you: your membership renewal has been accepted!

Unfortunately there is still one little thing that we have to take care of before
you get access to everything Thalia has to offer once again: paying your membership fees.

The membership fees are €{{ fees }}. Those can be paid in a few ways:
{% if thalia_pay_enabled %}
- You can let us withdraw the money from your bank account via Thalia Pay. For this, you
will need to have a bank account added to your account and have signed a direct debit mandate.
To pay with Thalia Pay, go to {{ url }}.
{% endif %}
- You can transfer the amount of €{{ fees }} to NL 23 INGB 0006 2341 84 with the description "Contribution {{ name }}".
Once your payment is processed by us, you will receive a confirmation email.

- You can pay using debit card or cash by visiting the Thalia board room (M1.0.08) during the lunch break (12:15-13:15).

If you have any questions, then don't hesitate and send an email to info@thalia.nu.

With kind regards,

The board of Study Association Thalia
