{% load i18n %}{% blocktrans %}Dear {{ name }},

We have some wonderful news for you: your membership renewal has been accepted!

Unfortunately there is still one little thing that we have to take care of before
you get access to everything Thalia has to offer once again: paying your membership fees.

The membership fees are €{{ fees }} and can be paid using cash or a debit card.

Please visit us during lunch break (12:30-13:30) in M1.0.08 so that we can
make sure your membership renewal is completed.

If you have any questions, then don't hesitate and send an email to info@thalia.nu.

With kind regards,

The board of Study Association Thalia
