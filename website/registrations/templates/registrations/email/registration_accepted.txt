Dear {{ name }},

We have some wonderful news for you: your membership registration has been accepted!

Unfortunately there is still one little thing that we have to take care of before
you get access to everything Thalia has to offer: paying your membership fees.

If possible, please visit us during lunch break (12:15-13:15) in M1.0.08 so that we can
make sure your registration is completed.

The membership fees are €{{ fees }} and can be paid using cash, a debit card or via wire transfer.
You can transfer the amount of €{{ fees }} to NL 23 INGB 0006 2341 84 with the description "Contribution {{ name }}".
Once your payment is processed by us, you will receive an email with your login credentials.
In the case you want to pay using a different method you can send an email to treasurer@thalia.nu.

If you have any other questions, then don't hesitate and send an email to info@thalia.nu.

With kind regards,

The board of Study Association Thalia
