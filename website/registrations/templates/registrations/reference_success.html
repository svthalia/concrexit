            It is still possible to be associated with Thalia, even if you do not study Computing
            Science or Information Sciences (anymore): You can become a benefactor.
            If you are not a former Thalia member, iCIS staff member or alumni,
            you must collect two references of current Thalia members.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>{{ name }}</strong> wants to become a benefactor of Thalia and
            needs such a reference and has asked you to give it to them.
