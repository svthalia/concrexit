            At Thalia, we take security of our infrastructure and digital systems seriously.
            We develop, build and deploy all systems with security in mind.
            However, we can never be 100% secure and vulnerabilities will, unfortunately, present themselves.
            If you find a (potential) vulnerability or security issue, we would appreciate it if you inform us as soon as possible.
