    <h3>Version 1.2, 2023-12-16</h3>
    <p>
        At Thalia, we take security of our infrastructure and digital systems seriously.
        We develop, build and deploy all systems with security in mind.
        However, we can never be 100% secure and vulnerabilities will, unfortunately, present themselves.
        If you find a (potential) vulnerability or security issue, we would appreciate it if you inform us as soon as possible.
        Please note that we <i> do not</i> pay out money for found vulnerabilities.
    </p>
