    <h3>Version 2.7, 2023-12-14</h3>
    <p>
        This document contains the privacy conditions of Study Association Thalia.
        The conditions are applicable on all members, benefactors, honorary members of Thalia and
        people who have started the registration process. Where there are differences in the
        applicability of the conditions on the mentioned groups this will be stated.
    </p>
    <h4>1. Categories of personal data</h4>
    <p>
        All data are stored at least for the length of the membership, unless stated otherwise.
        The account on the Thalia-website will be operational even after the end of the membership or
        benefactorship to allow easy renewals.

        The address information, phone number, profile picture, emergency contact, date of birth and
        student number are deleted 90 days after the end of a person's last membership. These data
        are not deleted immediately after the end of the membership to allow for easy renewals.

        The user's username, email address, and membership history are kept indefinitely for the
        sake of keeping in contact with alumni, and to keep the association's history.

        A person can request immediate deletion of their data by sending an
        email to <a href="mailto:info@thalia.nu">info@thalia.nu</a>.
    </p>
    <h5>Applicable to members, benefactors and honorary members:</h5>
    <p>
        <strong>Full name</strong><br/>
        Thalia uses the name of members, benefactors and honorary members for its administration and for
        personalising its communication.
        Processing of these data happens on the basis of it being necessary to fulfill the membership
        agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Address</strong><br/>
        Thalia uses the address of the members, benefactors and honorary members for its administration and
        for sending the association magazine.
        Processing of these data happens on the basis of it being necessary to fulfill the membership
        agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Email address</strong><br/>
        Thalia uses the email addresses of members, benefactors and honorary members to communicate about
        policy and financial matters and
        for sending the weekly newsletter as well as member specific communication (about an event for
        example). The email addresses are also used to enable functionality provided by the
        website (such as to reset passwords). Processing of these data happens on the basis of it being
        necessary to fulfill the membership agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Phone number</strong><br/>
        Thalia uses the phone number of members, benefactors and honorary members to communicate with members
        about activities of Thalia.
        Think about calling a participant who is too late for an activity or communicating a last-minute
        change. The processing of phone numbers by Thalia is optional.
        Processing of these data happens based on consent, which is given implicitly when the phone number
        is entered during registration or on the user profile on the website.
    </p>
    <p>
        NB: For some events, processing of the phone number is needed because of the nature of the event.
        Processing will happen per activity and will be explained where applicable.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Date of birth</strong><br/>
        Thalia uses the date of birth of members, benefactors and honorary members to determine
        whether they are of age. Besides this the date of birth is processed to display the birthday
        in the calendar if the member, benefactor or honorary member explicitly chose to allow this
        in their profile.
        Processing of these data happens on the basis of it being a legitimate interest of Thalia.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>{% trans "Profile" %}</strong><br/>
        {% blocktrans trimmed %}
            Some data that is part of the member profile is shown to other members, including for example
            the profile picture and profile text. Logged-in users can always view exactly what is shown via
            the <a href="https://thalia.nu/members/profile/">Show public profile</a> button in the user dropdown menu.
            Additionally, if a member is in a committee or board with publicly visible member list, some of their information
            (including displayed name and profile picture) will be visible to anyone including people outside of Thalia, and can
            also be indexed by search engines.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Bank account number</strong><br/>
        Thalia uses the bank account number of members, benefactors and honorary members when they pay via
        bank transfer or when they declare costs with Thalia.
        These data are saved for as long as required by law for the financial administration of Thalia.
        Processing of these data happens on the basis of it being necessary to fulfill the membership agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Emergency contact</strong><br/>
        There is a possibility to add an emergency contact to the user profile on the website,
        so this person can be contacted if it’s needed. Adding an emergency contact is optional.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Data collected on the website</strong><br/>
        Certain actions on the website may cause data to be collected (such as ordering food on the
        website or registering to attend an event). Processing of these data happens on the basis of
        it being a legitimate interest of Thalia.

        <br/>

        We additionally may collect data (logs) on anything happening on the site and app to ensure
        the correct functioning of the services provided, the username of a authenticated user is
        sent along with the logs.
        See the <a href="#sentry">section below on Functional Software, Inc.</a> for information on
        where this data is sent. Thalia tries to only collect data when errors occur. The logs are
        used to fix bugs in the website and app.
        Processing of these data happens on the basis of it being a legitimate interest of Thalia.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>{% trans "Sales" %}</strong><br/>
        When making a purchase at (an event of) Thalia, this can be recorded. This happens on the
        basis of it being a legal requirement of Thalia to keep their financial administration up-to-date.
    </p>
    <h5>{% trans "Applicable to members:" %}</h5>
    <p>
        <strong>{% trans "Student number" %}</strong><br/>
        Thalia uses the student number of members to check if they are still studying and to receive
        grants and subsidies. Student numbers are only shared with the Radboud University or
        organisations which operate on behalf of the Radboud University.
        Processing of these data happens on the basis of it being a legitimate interest of Thalia.
    </p>
    <h5>{% trans "Applicable to everyone:" %}</h5>
    <p>
        <strong>{% trans "Photos" %}</strong><br/>
        Thalia uses photo’s which are made during her events for the promotion of events and the
        association. These photo's can be made available on the website of Thalia for members, or
        they can be posted on social media accounts of Thalia. If such image is posted on a social
        media platform other than the website of Thalia, permission will be asked to all
        recognisable persons in the picture if this is feasible.

        It is possible to ask for the removal of a certain photo from the website or social media
        when someone on that photo desires so, by sending a mail to
        <a href="mailto:info@thalia.nu">info@thalia.nu</a>.

        Processing of this data happens on the basis of it being a legitimate interest of Thalia.

        When someone wishes not to be photographed, they can indicate this to the photographer.
        A request of deletion of a certain photo can also be made after it has been taken, by
        sending a mail to <a href="mailto:info@thalia.nu">info@thalia.nu</a>.
    </p>
    <h5>{% trans "Applicable to upcoming members:" %}</h5>
    <p>
        Registrations which have been completed or rejected will be removed after 31 days.
    </p>
    <p>
        A registration that is still in the process of collecting references, reviewing by the board,
        or waiting for payment is not removed automatically. A person can request immediate deletion
        of their data by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@thalia.nu">info@thalia.nu</a>.
    </p>
    <h5>{% trans "Face recognition" %}</h5>
    <p>
        Photos uploaded to Thalia's website are scanned on faces. This is done on our own servers,
        using open source models. No third parties will receive these photos for this purpose and
        the photos are not used to train models. Face recognition is only used to allow members to
        easily search for photos they appear on, and not for any other purpose.
        Members are not allowed to use face recognition to search for photos of other members.
        Measures are implemented to prevent this as much as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to use face recognition, members need to upload a photo of their own face, a
        so-called reference face. This photo is stored on our servers and is used to compare faces
        in photos uploaded to the website. This reference face is only used for face recognition and
        is not used for any other purpose. It will never be made public.
        Members can delete their reference face at any time. After deletion, however, the reference
        face will not be immediately deleted. This allows us to monitor if people actually searched
        for photos of others.
    </p>
    <h5>{% trans "Other processing of personal data" %}</h5>
    <p>
        For activities of Thalia, additional personal data may be needed. Examples include allergy
        information or dietary preferences when there is an event with food, or shirt size when
        clothing is given to participants of an event.

        These data will be processed and explained per event.
    </p>
