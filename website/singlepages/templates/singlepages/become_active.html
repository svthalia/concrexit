        {% blocktrans trimmed %}Throughout the year, Thalia organizes a wide variety of activities, both educational
        (such as symposiums and programming contests) as well as social (such as drinks, paintballing and LAN
        parties). All in all, this adds up to around 80 activities each year. The board and Thalia's committees
        organize these events. Furthermore, Thalia members are involved in e.g. writing the Thabloid,
        maintaining this website and our servers, and taking pictures during events. Altogether, a group of 50
        to 60 members commits to making all these amazing activities happen every year.{% endblocktrans %}

        {% blocktrans trimmed %}Does it seem like fun to join a committee and do your bit to contribute to the
        association? Then become a member of one of the committees! You can do this by sending an e-mail to
        <a href="mailto:intern@thalia.nu">intern@thalia.nu</a>, sending a Facebook message or speaking to a
        board or committee member in person.{% endblocktrans %}

        {% blocktrans trimmed %}Are you not sure if being part of a committee is for you? You can always sit in on a
        meeting to see if you like it. Again, feel free to ask committee members or the board in person. The
        committees are always looking for enthusiastic new members!{% endblocktrans %}
