        {% blocktrans trimmed %}
            These terms and conditions were drafted to ensure that Thalia doesn’t incur
            costs for people who register for an event, but don’t show up. Through this,
            there will be more spots at events for people who will actually participate.
        {% endblocktrans %}

    <h4> {% trans "1. Stipulations" %} </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                A cancellation deadline will be disclosed for each event where a
                registration is needed. When a person who is registered wants to cancel their
                registration, they should do this prior to the cancellation deadline.
            {% endblocktrans %}
        </li>
        <li>
            {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                When someone doesn’t cancel his registration on time and doesn’t attend
                the event, they owe Thalia a compensation of the expenses for the event
                per person, with a minimum of €5.
            {% endblocktrans %}
        </li>
        <li>
            {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                It is the responsibility of the registered person to make sure that this
                person is on the attendance list: it is leading for determining whether
                they attended the event.
            {% endblocktrans %}
        </li>
        <li>
            {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                The compensation stated on the event page is only an estimate of the
                actual figure.
            {% endblocktrans %}
        </li>
        <li>
            {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                This compensation needs to be paid within two weeks from the invoice
                date. If the payment isn’t fulfilled within two weeks from the invoice
                date, the person concerned will not be allowed to attend events with the
                exception of borrels of S.A. Thalia. If the payment isn’t fulfilled within
                four weeks from the invoice date, the person concerned will not be allowed
                to attend borrels of S.A. Thalia. These prohibitions to visit borrels and
                events will end as soon as the payment of the compensation is fulfilled.
            {% endblocktrans %}
        </li>
        <li>
            {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                The board can exempt people from paying the compensation if there are
                significant reasons for not attending the event. For this, an e-mail should
                be sent to treasurer@thalia.nu. The board will decide if reasons for not
                attending an event are significant.
