Hi {{ name }},

You registered for the event '{{ event.title }}' on {{ registration.date|date:"SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT" }} and unfortunately you were placed on the waiting list.
However someone just unregistered and we would like to let you know that you'll be able to attend now!

You can find more information about the event on the website: {{ base_url }}{{ event.get_absolute_url }}

We're assuming that you'll be there, but you're still able to unregister until {{ event.cancel_deadline|date:"SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT" }}.
If this date has already passed you can contact the organisers via {{ organisers|join:", " }}.

Best regards,
Study Association Thalia
