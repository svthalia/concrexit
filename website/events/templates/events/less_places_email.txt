You were registered for the event '{{ event_title }}'.
Unfortunately, the maximum number of registrations has been reduced and you will not be able to join anymore. We apologize for the inconvenience.

That said, you are still on the waiting list so if some spots get re-added or in case of cancellations you may still be able to join anyway.

If you have any questions you can contact the {{ organiser_name }} via {{ organsiser_mail }}.

Best regards,
Study Association Thalia{% endblocktrans %}
