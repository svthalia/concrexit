    <p>
        Upload a reference photo of yourself and we'll look for other photos you appear on.
        Note that for the best result, this reference photo should only contain your face.
        It may take some time until we have processed your reference photo.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Face recognition is intended to be used for <em>your own</em> faces only.</li>
        <li>You can have a maximum of {{ reference_faces_limit }} reference faces uploaded.</li>
        <li>You can only search for faces for the period that you've been a member.</li>
        <li>
            After you have uploaded a reference face, you can not just delete it.
            We will store your reference faces for {{ storage_period_after_delete }} more days after you delete them.
            This allows us to monitor if you actually searched for photos of others.
