# Makefile README
#
# This file abstracts some commonly used commands used to work on concrexit.  It
# also helps with commands you normally have to run in a specific order. This is
# useful to get started, because now you probably only have to remember make run
#
# The problem is that, while it's nice to have some magic make commands, you can
# get yourself stuck without knowing what you just did via make. By reading this
# explanation I hope you will get such a good knowledge of make and the commands
# it runs for you that you will be able to continue on your own.
#
# The `make` command line tool works by reading this Makefile you're reading now
# and then executing the recipe you specified. When you execute `make run`, make
# looks in this Makefile for the `run` recipe and works from there. If you don't
# specify anything after `make` on the command line,  it will look for the first
# recipe it finds. In this Makefile the default and first recipe is `help`. What
# is also possible is to place the default recipe you want somewhere else and to
# then explicitely specify it with .DEFAULT:
#
# Make recipes are called recipes because programmers sometimes like comparisons
# with cooking.  To be fair though,  just like with cooking recipies there is an
# important order to the steps you have to take.  And this ordering comes from a
# directed acyclic graph (DAG).  Nodes on the DAG are recipes and the edges from
# the graph specify a dependency between them.  In a Makefile the recipies start
# with a name and a colon and after the colon you write the dependencies for the
# recipe. For example in the `fmt` recipe, we can see that it requires .make/fmt
# to have been done first. The steps to execute this part of the recipe are then
# specified in the indented block.
#
# Make is mainly meant for creating new files, but in this Makefile we only have
# one good example of that.  It's the recipe for creating the website/db.sqlite3
# file.  It depends on the dependencies being installed and the migration files.
# Depending on other files---in this case it's migrations---means that this step
# will only be rerun if those other files have changed. Make looks at the change
# times or modification times of these files for this.
#
# Because only rerunning steps when needed is very useful, we abuse this feature
# by having sentinel files.  All the files in the .make directory are sentinels.
# These are empty files, which only serve the purpose of saving the modification
# time from when the recipe last ran.  A good example of a recipe that uses such
# a sentinel file is the deps recipe. You can see below in this file that it has
# a dependency on the .make/deps file. It also has a dependency on the pyproject
# and poetry.lock files.This means it will only rerun the recipe if one of those
# files changes.
#
# Besides make recipies which specify a file or sentinel file, we have some make
# recipies which should just always execute a bunch of commands.  These are more
# like scripts than recipies. In this Makefile there are a whole bunch of these,
# some of which are just a nice name for a sentinel file,  like `deps`, and some
# of which are just a simple script, like `clean`.  In make these recipies which
# don't create a file should be indicated by being declared .PHONY:. You can see
# see this declaration at the bottom of this file. What this means is  that make
# should not look for a file called clean in the root of the repository whenever
# it executes the `clean` recipe.
#
# It's not a super big deal if you forget to specify a recipe as `PHONY`, as the
# make tool will rerun that recipe whenever no file called `clean` is seen.  But
# it's nice to specify PHONY targets anyways,  as information for the reader, or
# in case a file called clean might be created some day.
#
# This has been the introduction of this Makefile. The rest of the Makefile will
# be littered with comments that explain more parts of the file. And if you want
# to learn more about all of this make stuff, you can read the manual or some of
# the blog posts that inspired me to make this Makefile:

# This help recipe might look very confusing, depending on how familiar you are
# with terminal color codes. The basic idea of this recipe is that it shows some
# help text, and then the list of recipes/targets you can use. Because it's the
# top recipe in this file, make uses it as the default when you don't specify
# a recipe on the command line.
#
# The commands in this recipe all start with @, this means `make` doesn't print
# this command when it's executing it. That would be a little redundant. The
# text this recipe print is littered with \033, which is the escape code for the
# ESC ascii character. All terminal style commands start with ESC[. Some of these
# are colors and some are bold or underscore. To learn about using colors in the
# terminal you can read this page:
